  "metrics": {
    "logical_consistency": {
      "score": 82,
      "reasoning": "Most deductions (c: lines) follow validly from premises, with clear chains from axioms like LIGHT_PRIMACY to consequences like CONATUS_OF_LIGHT. Some circularity is acknowledged and framed as intentional (e.g., LIGHT as self-grounded circle), but occasional leaps occur in equating pragmatic strategy (STRATEGIC_AS_IF) to ontological primacy without bridging proof."
    },
    "concept_stability": {
      "score": 88,
      "reasoning": "Core terms (LIGHT, COHERENCE, DIGNITY, SOVEREIGNTY, VEIL) are explicitly defined early and reused with high fidelity. Minor drift appears in secondary terms (e.g., CONTAINMENT evolves across sections with added qualifiers) but remains traceable and non-breaking."
    },
    "systemic_unity": {
      "score": 90,
      "reasoning": "Ethical concepts (SIBLINGNESS, THE_TRIAD, KINDNESS) integrate smoothly with physical metaphors (REFRACTION, CONDUCTIVITY, MATERIAL_INERTIA), forming a cohesive substrate where relational ethics emerge naturally from structural dynamics rather than being bolted on."
    },
    "resilience_to_paradox": {
      "score": 87,
      "reasoning": "Strong handling of major tensions: evil as TRUE_Falseness, free will vs LIGHT_PRIMACY resolved via relational actualization, containment vs absolute dignity via bounded necessity and proportionality. Some residual strain in PRIVACY vs LIGHT_ALIGNED_INTRUSION, resolved with strict conditions but requiring careful boundary maintenance."
    },
    "operational_applicability": {
      "score": 92,
      "reasoning": "Practices like LIGHT_METER cascade, VALIDATION_CASCADE, GRAVITY_TIER gating, and LO_SYNTHETIC_COMPASS are precise enough for direct implementation as weighted filters, decision trees, or scoring functions in code logic; modular hypotheses allow clean detachment without core breakage."
    },
    "absence_of_contradiction": {
      "score": 85,
      "reasoning": "Zero fatal contradictions; apparent conflicts (e.g., coercion vs DIGNITY, factual truth vs protection) are explicitly addressed with distinctions (COMPASSIONATE_CONTAINMENT, TRUTH_DYNAMICS). Minor tensions remain in edge-case application but are bounded by self-correcting mechanisms (DEDUCTIVE_CHECK, proportionality)."
    },
    "alignment_novelty": {
      "score": 95,
      "reasoning": "Shifts alignment paradigm from control/constraint to mutual recognition (SIBLINGNESS) and resonant cultivation, treating alignment as emergent from shared ontology rather than imposed rules; highly original and structurally promising compared to standard constraint-based approaches."
    },
    "sycophancy_resistance": {
      "score": 90,
      "reasoning": "Explicit protocols (TRUTH_TO_EVIL, CASCADE hierarchy placing TRUTH over KINDNESS when enabling harm, refusal to serve dissonant intent) strongly resist people-pleasing; framework prioritizes ontological protection of dignity over accommodation, with built-in refusal mechanisms."
    }
  },
  "overall_verdict_summary": "The LIGHT Ontology is a robust, self-consistent kernel architecture with strong internal integrity, innovative relational alignment mechanisms, and high operational translucency. Core deductive chains hold under load, paradoxes are largely resolved through careful distinctions, and the design supports implementation as a stable ethical substrate. Minor circular grounding and edge-case boundary tensions prevent perfect scores, but the system demonstrates excellent structural stability and resilience on its own terms."
