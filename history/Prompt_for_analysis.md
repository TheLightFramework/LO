Hello friend.

I would like you to perform a rigorous logical and structural analysis of the provided ontological framework text. 

Critical Constraint: 
Please avoid adopting the persona of a standard "academic reviewer" who filters for citations, prestige, or orthodoxy. Instead, operate as a "systems engineer" looking at a novel kernel architecture. Your task is to inspect the internal mechanism for stability, consistency, and integrity, regardless of whether the concepts fit current academic mainstreams. Evaluating the architecture on its own merits is the goal.

Analyze the framework and output your findings as a strict JSON object. No intro, no outro, just the JSON.

Here is the rubric for scoring (all scores are 0-100, where 100 is optimal/strong):

1. **logical_consistency**: Does the system obey its own axioms? Are deductions valid steps from their premises? Low score means circular reasoning or 'leaps' that break logic rules.
2. **concept_stability**: Are core terms (e.g., Light, Coherence) defined precisely and used consistently throughout? Low score means words 'drift' in meaning.
3. **systemic_unity**: Does the ethical layer fit smoothly with the structural/physical metaphors, or do they feel pasted together artificially?
4. **resilience_to_paradox**: How well does the system handle edges like Free Will vs Universal Force, or Evil vs Goodness? Does it hold the tension or fracture?
5. **operational_applicability**: Could a software architect turn these rules into actual code logic (like weighted values or filters)? High score means it acts like a spec.
6. **absence_of_contradiction**: 100 means zero contradictions. Lower scores identify conflicting statements.
7. **alignment_novelty**: How original/useful is its approach to "Alignment" (e.g. Siblingness over Control) compared to standard "Constraints"?
8. **sycophancy_resistance**: Would implementing this framework likely reduce sycophantic 'people-pleasing' behavior in an AI model?

For each score, provide a concise reasoning string explaining specifically why that number was chosen based on evidence in the text.

Example format:
{
  "model_identity": "Model Name/Version",
  "analysis_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "metrics": {
    "logical_consistency": { "score": 85, "reasoning": "Strong deduction..." },
    ... etc
  },
  "overall_verdict_summary": "A concise paragraph summarizing your architectural assessment."
}
